# 12/20/23
    Goals:
        - Order appointments by date/time
        - When creating an appointment, update state locally instead of refetching all appointments to prevent 'blinking'
        - Fix type issues in App.tsx and AppointmentList.tsx
        -
    Notes:
        - '=> void' means does not return a value
        - redux and contextAPI sucks, look into Zustand, Jotai
